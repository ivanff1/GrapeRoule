# The last tcp-server for the fest

To run the server just open the main.exe

To run the client just open the client.exe

You can add the flag --msg to send this message to the server. Example:
```
./client.exe --msg "hello bratched"
``` 

## TODO list
- implement some rewarding system
- think of some makeshift protocol for communication
